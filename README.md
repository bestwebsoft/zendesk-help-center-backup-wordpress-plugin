Zendesk Help Center Backup is a simple yet highly convenient plugin that creates a backup copy of your Zendesk Help Center to the database. The backup is made through the cron within the time frame specified in the settings. The time of the last backup, as well as logs, are displayed on the plugin settings page. Also, in case backup error occurs, the plugin sends a message to the email, which is also specified in the settings.
